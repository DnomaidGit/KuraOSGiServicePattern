# KuraOSGiServicePattern
This is a simple example of an OSGi Service Pattern project for Eclipse Kura.
***
## Development Environment
* Eclipse Neon Version: 2019-09 R (4.13.0). An additional plugin, mToolkit, is needed to allow remote connectivity to an OSGi framework on a Kura-enabled target device. To install mToolkit into Eclipse, use the following steps: 
  + Open the Help | Install New Software… menu.
  + Add the following URL as an update site based on your version of Eclipse http://mtoolkit-neon.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
  + Install the “mToolkit” feature (you need to uncheck the Group items by category checkbox in order to see the feature).
  + Restart Eclipse. In the menu Window | Show View | Other, there should be an mToolkit | Frameworks option. If so, the plugin has been installed correctly.
* Development platform Linux (Debian 10).
